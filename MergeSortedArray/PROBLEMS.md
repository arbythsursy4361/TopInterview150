You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2,  
sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n,  
representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.  
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.  

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], nums2 = [2,5,6],  
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
